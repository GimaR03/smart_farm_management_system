# 🌿🐄 Mount Olive – Smart Farm Management System
### Animal & Plant Health Management Module (MERN Stack)

> This repository represents **my individual contribution** to the *Mount Olive – Smart Farm Management System*, developed as part of my **2nd Year, 2nd Semester Information Technology academic project at SLIIT**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Mount Olive – Smart Farm Management System** is a comprehensive smart farming platform developed to centralize and automate core farm operations. The system improves efficiency, monitoring, and decision-making through modern web technologies, real-time communication, and IoT integration.

This repository focuses on the **Animal Health Management** and **Plant Health Management** modules, which I designed and implemented independently.

---

## 🎯 My Contribution

I was responsible for the **design and development** of the following components:

- Animal Health Management  
- Plant Health Management  
- Real-time health monitoring dashboards  
- IoT data integration and visualization  

This work was completed as part of a **group project**, but this repository contains **only my implemented modules**.

---

## 🧩 Integrated Farm Modules (System Context)

The complete system integrates:
- Animal Management  
- Plant Management  
- Health Management  
- Inventory Control  
- Employee Administration  

My contribution supports the **health monitoring and data analysis layer** of the system.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technologies |
|--------------|--------------|
| Frontend     | React.js |
| Backend      | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database     | MongoDB |
| Real-Time    | Socket.io |
| IoT          | ESP32 |
| Architecture | MERN Stack |

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The system follows a **MERN Stack architecture** with RESTful APIs. ESP32-based IoT devices collect live sensor data, which is transmitted to the backend and displayed on the frontend dashboards in real time using Socket.io. MongoDB stores all farm-related health records and monitoring data.

---

## 📡 Real-Time Monitoring & IoT Integration

- Real-time data synchronization using **Socket.io**
- Live environmental and health data from **ESP32 IoT devices**
- Instant updates for timely farm management decisions
